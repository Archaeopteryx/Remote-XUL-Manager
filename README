Remote XUL Manager is a tool created in response to the following Mozilla
bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=595260.

This is an extension for Firefox (and potentially other applications) that
allows developers to easily manage the Remote XUL domain whitelist, enabling
specific domains where the user wants to enable remote XUL.

Version 0.6 is a basic add/remove tool. Future versions will likely include more
useful features for remote deployment.
